# Wednesday Week39

[slides for today](https://github.com/Jilong-Jerome/Evolutionary_Thinking_2022/blob/main/week39/Wednesday/Week_5_s1.pdf)

## Work plan

### 1. Nielsen and Slatkin book exercises - Chapter 1, 2, 3

During this TA you will have time to answer the Nielsen and Slatkin book exercises, Chapter 1, 2, 3. Since it's quite some, try to do some work at home and leave the exercises you find more difficult to do in class. 

Because the exercises can't be publicly distributed, you will find two links in this week's directory under the "Materials" section in Black Board, one for the exercises and the other for the google docs.

Solutions to odd number exercises can be found at the end of the book and solutions to even numbers can be found [here](http://people.bu.edu/msoren/BI515_2014/EvenNumberedSolutions.pdf).
