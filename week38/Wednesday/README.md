## Work plan

We are going to discuss the HIV infection in a dentist paper and answer some questions about it in a shared google docs document.

### The HIV infection paper

You should read this paper before Wednesday class:

Then, you are going to comment it in groups (4-5 people) and answer the questions that you can find in the [shared google docs](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iLp0H0AIKhV9dgnz234xlL_n2yoD71xaBotuI1Oj8JM/edit?usp=sharing). Each group is going to be in charge of some questions and they will have to write the answer that we all come up with.
