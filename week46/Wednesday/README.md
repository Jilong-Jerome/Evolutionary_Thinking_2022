# Wednesday Week46

## Work plan

We are going to discuss two short papers published 10 years apart by the same authors, that have to do with resolving incongruences of phylogenetic trees, so please read them by Wednesday:

Rokas et al. [Genome-scale approaches to resolving incongruence in molecular phylogenies](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature02053). Nature, 2003.

Salichos & Rokas. [Inferring ancient divergences requires genes with strong phylogenetic signals](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature12130). Nature, 2013.
